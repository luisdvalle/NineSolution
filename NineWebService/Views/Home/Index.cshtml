<p>Standalone JSON-based web service. It filters JSON data and return some determined fields.</p>

<p>Details From the list of shows in the request payload, return the ones with DRM enabled (drm: true) and at least
    one episode (episodeCount > 0).</p>

<p>The returned JSON should have a response key with an array of shows. Each element should have the following fields
    from the request:</p>

<ul>
    <li>image - corresponding to image/showImage from the request payload</li>
    <li>slug</li>
    <li>title</li>
    <li>
        Error Handling If invalid JSON is sent, the application will return a JSON response with HTTP status 400 Bad
        Request, and with a error key containing the string Could not decode request. For example: 
        { "error": "Could not decode request: JSON parsing failed" }
    </li>
</ul>
